This package provides TypeScript bindings for the Akash API, generated from protobuf definitions.

## Installation

To install the package, run:

```bash
npm install @akashnetwork/akash-api
```

## Usage

You can import the generated namespaces from the package like this:
```typescript
import * as akashDeploymentV1beta1 from '@akashnetwork/akash-api/akash/deployment/v1beta1';
import * as akashDiscoveryV1 from '@akashnetwork/akash-api/akash/discovery/v1';
// ... and so on for other namespaces
```

### TypeScript 4.5 and above
If you're using TypeScript 4.5 or above, the package exports all the paths of the generated namespaces, so you can import them directly.  

### TypeScript below 4.5
If you're using a version of TypeScript below 4.5, the package provides a tsconfig.paths.json file that you can extend in your local TypeScript configuration to resolve the paths. Here's how you can do it:  In your tsconfig.json file, add the following:
```json
{
  "extends": "@akashnetwork/akash-api/tsconfig.paths.json"
}
```

### Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Please submit a pull request or create an issue to discuss the changes you want to make.

### Contributing to Generated Files

The files in the `src/generated` directory are auto-generated and should not be modified directly. If you need to make changes to these files, follow the steps below:

1. Create a new file in the `src/patch` directory with the same path as the file you want to modify. For example, if you want to modify `src/generated/cosmos/base/v1beta1/coin.ts`, you should create the directory `src/patch/cosmos/base/v1beta1/coin.ts`.

2. Add your changes to a new file in the `src/patch` directory. The new file should have the same name as the file you want to modify.

3. Rename the original file in the `src/generated` directory by appending `.original.ts` to its name. For example, `src/generated/cosmos/base/v1beta1/coin.ts` should be renamed to `src/generated/cosmos/base/v1beta1/coin.original.ts`.

4. Create a new file in the `src/generated` directory with the same name as the original file. This new file should re-export everything from the corresponding file in the `src/patch` directory. For example, the content of `src/generated/cosmos/base/v1beta1/coin.ts` should be:

```typescript
export * from '../../../../patch/cosmos/base/v1beta1/coin';
```

NOTE: Naming and paths are important to prevent the original file from being overwritten when the code is regenerated. See `script/preserve-ts-patches.sh` and `script/restore-ts-patches.sh` for more implementation details.
