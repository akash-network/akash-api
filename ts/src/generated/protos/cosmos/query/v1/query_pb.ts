/**
 * module_query_safe is set to true when the query is safe to be called from
 * within the state machine, for example from another module's Keeper, via
 * ADR-033 calls or from CosmWasm contracts.
 * Concretely, it means that the query is:
 * 1. deterministic: given a block height, returns the exact same response
 * upon multiple calls; and doesn't introduce any state-machine-breaking
 * changes across SDK patch version.
 * 2. consumes gas correctly.
 *
 * If you are a module developer and want to add this annotation to one of
 * your own queries, please make sure that the corresponding query:
 * 1. is deterministic and won't introduce state-machine-breaking changes
 * without a coordinated upgrade path,
 * 2. has its gas tracked, to avoid the attack vector where no gas is
 * accounted for on potentially high-computation queries.
 *
 * For queries that potentially consume a large amount of gas (for example
 * those with pagination, if the pagination field is incorrectly set), we
 * also recommend adding Protobuf comments to warn module developers
 * consuming these queries.
 *
 * When set to true, the query can safely be called
 *
